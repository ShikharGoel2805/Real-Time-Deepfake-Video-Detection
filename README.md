# 🧠 Real-Time Deepfake Detection System

This project aims to build a real-time deepfake video detection system that can work with uploaded videos, YouTube links, and live video streams (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet). It leverages deep learning and computer vision techniques to identify manipulated facial movements and inconsistencies in visual and audio patterns.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Detect deepfakes from:
  - Uploaded video files (`.mp4`, `.avi`)
  - Video URLs (YouTube)
  - Real-time video from webcam or screen share
- ✅ Face detection and alignment using MediaPipe / MTCNN
- ✅ Classification using CNN/LSTM-based deep learning models
- ✅ Output live detection overlay (bounding box + result)
- ✅ Integration-ready with Zoom / Meet using PyVirtualCam
- ✅ Performance logging and visualization
